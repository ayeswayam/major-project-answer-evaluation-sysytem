Theoretical Answer Evaluation System
Overview
The Theoretical Answer Evaluation System is an AI-powered solution for automating the assessment of subjective (theoretical) answers. The system leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate descriptive answers by comparing them with model answers and analyzing key aspects of the text.
Key Features
•	Automated Evaluation: Efficiently grades subjective answers based on multiple criteria
•	NLP-Based Analysis: Utilizes advanced NLP models to understand the semantics of text
•	OCR Integration: Support for processing handwritten answers through OCR
•	Detailed Feedback: Provides comprehensive feedback on student responses
•	User-Friendly Interface: Streamlit-based interface for easy interaction
Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture with the following components:
1.	Text Preprocessing: Cleans and normalizes text data
2.	Feature Extraction: Extracts semantic and structural features
3.	Evaluation Model: Compares responses against model answers
4.	Scoring System: Applies weighted scoring based on multiple criteria
5.	Feedback Generation: Creates detailed feedback for improvement
Installation
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/theoretical-answer-evaluation-system.git
