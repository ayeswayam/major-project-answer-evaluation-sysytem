      "response_text": "Inheritance is when one class takes on the attributes and methods of another class. The child class inherits from the parent class. This helps in code reuse. For example, if we have a parent class 'Vehicle', then classes like 'Car' and 'Bike' can inherit from it and have common properties like 'speed' and methods like 'accelerate'.",

      "response_text": "Inheritance in OOP allows a new class to be based on an existing class. The new class (subclass) inherits attributes and behaviors from the existing class (superclass). This creates a parent-child relationship between classes. Inheritance supports code reusability and helps establish a hierarchical relationship. It also enables polymorphism, where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. Methods can be overridden in subclasses to provide specific implementations.",

      "response_text": "Preprocessing is essential in machine learning pipelines as it prepares raw data for modeling. It involves several key steps: data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers, normalization to bring features to a similar scale, feature encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format, and feature selection to identify the most relevant variables. Proper preprocessing improves model performance by reducing noise, ensuring algorithm assumptions are met, and addressing issues like class imbalance. It also helps in dimensionality reduction, which reduces computational complexity and prevents overfitting. Overall, preprocessing directly influences the accuracy, efficiency, and generalization capability of machine learning models.",

Common complexities include O(1) for constant time, O(n) for linear time, O(nÂ²) for quadratic time, and O(log n) for logarithmic time algorithms. It helps programmers make informed decisions about algorithm selection based on performance requirements.",
